## OHME V1 Bugs

##--------------------------------

1. Few HRUs are defined a FORESTED Land Use Class and GRASS Vegetation Class, and few are defined as FORESTED Land Use Class and SHRUBLAND Vegetation Class. The reason for this is likely an artifact of the adjustments made following HRU definition to account for Residual / Natural land bases.
  - This is a result of "FORESTED" being the most common land use type (which consists of FORESTED, CONFIEROUS, BROADLEAF, etc. vegetation types) and GRASS (or SHRUBLAND) being only slightly less. Therefore, FORESTED makes up the most land use, but consists of multiple vegetation types, whereas GRASS (or SHRUBLAND) represents the largest vegetation type.
  - The number of HRUs where this is case is insignifcant within the watershed and this issue is not expected to significantly alter results.
  - The HRU definition process should be reviewed for these unique cases.
  
2. Within the "pure" HBV-EC model configuration, :LakeStorage is used to move all precipitation that falls onto LAKE HRUs into a storage compartment.
The "pure" HBV-EC model configuration uses SOIL[2] as this storage compartment. Based on a recommendation from James Craig, this component of the model was removed since it's physical representation is dubious. Precipitation on LAKE HRUs is not added directly to the Surface Water store.

In addition, the "pure" HBV-EC model configuration also has a :LakeEvaporation term to evaporate water from the above storage components (i.e., SOIL[2]). Due to the poor physical representation of this process, coupled with the removal of the :LakeStorage term, :LakeEvaporation was removed from the HBV-EC configuration used in OHME V1.

These adjustments result in large mass balance errors reported for watersheds that have one or more reservoirs present. It was traced to originate in the cumulative loss term within the reservoir mass balance. James Craig advised that this is likely not an issue with the model itself, but the mass balance calculations/checks performed by Raven. However, additional QAQC by James is required.

    *** THIS BUG HAS BEEN FIXED BY JAMES *** NO CHANGES TO HYDROGRAPHS WAS OBSERVERVED ***

3. Under residual streamflows (i.e., the inclusion of water demand from the OWDM and other diversions from the custom-timeseries), the Channel Storage compartment is observed to fill up. James Craig confirmed that this is an error in the mass balance calculations within Raven and will be fixed in due course.

    *** JAMES IS AWARE OF THIS BUG AND WILL FIX IN DUE COURSE ***

4. Update plotting functions to respect disabled subbasins is they are reservoirs. Right now, an error is thrown if there is a disabled subbasin that is a reservoir, because no column exists. Therefore, Powers Creek reservoir plots always fail since Tadpole Lake is permanently disabled. Include a simple if/else to only plot what is there.

5. Update plotting functions to correctly plot subbasin averaged SWE. Currently, this fails in Trout Creek since there are two subbasins with the same Snow_Course manually entered (2F01A) - this refers to LCTN_ID 2F01 and 2F01A. When plotting subbasin average, as well as the watershed name on HRU-average SWE results, this results in zero matches when finding the watershed/subbasin. This is because the command is looking for unique matches of all.snow.courses.included within the snow.course.locations object; however, 2F01 does not exist here (2F01A exists twice). This update should either be made in the subbasin_codes.csv and snow-course-locations-model-domain.csv OR update to use LCTN_ID rather than Snow_Course within the subset command. The snow data ingested into Raven is correct; this appears to only be an error in the plotting function.

    *** THIS BUG HAS BEEN FIXED AND TESTED ON TROUT CREEK WATERSHED - CONTINUED TESTING IS REQUIRED ***
    
6. If validate.model == TRUE and calibration and validation periods overlap, the observation weights are not written correctly. This is because the calibration period is written with zero weights whilst the validation period is written with 1 weights. This issue can be avoided if calibration dates always PRECEED the validation period.

7. MISSION CREEK - Flood diversion from Mill Creek currently enters the Mission Creek watershed in subbasin 202 (i.e., on the alluvial fan). However, it should come into subbasin 204, above the alluvial fan. Review the subbasin map and update the custom timeseries to define the correct To_Subbasin before providing additional model output for these lower subbasins.

8. Standard aspect convention computes aspect of slopes either (1) clockwise from north (north = 0); or (2) counterclockwise from east (east = 90). However, Raven requires aspect be computed as positive counter-clockwise (i.e., north = 0, west = 90, south = 180, east = 270). Aspect is currently calculated based on clockwise from north.
  - Aspect calculations should be updated and model calibrations adjusted as ncessary.
  - Preliminary tests suggest that this changes does NOT affect results within Mill/Mission Creek (based on coupled Natural Calibration 2).
  - If aspect is adjusted BEFORE HRUs are define, more HRUs are defined (assumed to be because cells on the margin of two aspect bins get pushed into the other bin). However, HRUs have not been redfined and climate data has not been remapped. Preliminary testing involved manually adjusting the MEAN aspect of each HRU (by: 360 - current value) to conform to the Raven requirement.
  
9. Some WATER / LAKE HRUs have non-zero slope: this is an artifact of the spatial overlay used to define HRUs (i.e., boundaries of water bodies defined by Dan, EOSD, and DEM). All HRUs / cells with LAKE/WATER should be overwritten to have zero slope in the same manor that land use / veg class is overwritten for these areas.

10. NO BUG - assess the impact of using median latitude / longitude rather than mean. Was was originally selected, but median is also appropriate. It is not expected to alter results much since lat/lon is only used for raiation modelling.

11. NO BUG - should maximum stage constraints (i.e., :ReservoirMaximumStage) timeseries be added to constrain reservoir stages to within the "Live" storage of all curves? Currently, reservoirs are allow to fill to the top of "Potential" storage. In practice, I don't think that this ever actually happens since reservoirs act as flow-through systems under natural conditions, and are often drawn-down under residual conditions.

12. NO BUG - Update subbasin_codes.csv to ensure that ALL available/possible WSC stations are captured. For example, WSC 08NM233 should be assigned to Mission Creek Subbasin 217 to ensure that data are retrieved under historic runs.

13. NO BUG - Check the code used to select file/value position for response variables in Ostrich File Generator. Currently, I believe %like% is used - it may make sense to update this to an exact "pattern match".

14. NO BUG - Check the output data files / Observed Input files for any required date offsets. Ensure that period-starting and period-ending is correctly captured.

15. NO BUG - Collate all calibrated reservoirs for Cal 1 and Cal 2 back into one master Excel workbook. This reduces the number of files that need to be maintained. Will have to correctly determine the "final" version for each Version 1 calibration and amalgamate into master version. This can be tied in with OHME Clean Up Task, and can maybe be coupled with update/inclusion of Stage-Area curve for each reservoir.

16. NO BUG - Check the generation of "AWDM weeks" - Ensure that week definitions match the AWDM and the associated weekly average/definition included in the Naturalized Streamflow datasets developed by Drew. Original code was written to match these, but this should be confirmed.

17. NO BUG - Collate all calibrated soil thicknesses for Cal 1 and Cal 2 back into master *.csv. In addition, explore opportunity to streamline this process.

18. Update plotting functions to account for 1-day offset in Model output. Output values relate to the PREVIOUS timestep, so a 1-day date shift is required. Ensure that all other datasets are read-in in appropriate period-starting/period-ending format.
