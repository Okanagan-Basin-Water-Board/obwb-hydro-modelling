## OHME V1 Bugs

##--------------------------------

1. Few HRUs are defined a FORESTED Land Use Class and GRASS Vegetation Class, and few are defined as FORESTED Land Use Class and SHRUBLAND Vegetation Class. The reason for this is likely an artifact of the adjustments made following HRU definition to account for Residual / Natural land bases.
  - This is a result of "FORESTED" being the most common land use type (which consists of FORESTED, CONFIEROUS, BROADLEAF, etc. vegetation types) and GRASS (or SHRUBLAND) being only slightly less. Therefore, FORESTED makes up the most land use, but consists of multiple vegetation types, whereas GRASS (or SHRUBLAND) represents the largest vegetation type.
  - The number of HRUs where this is case is insignifcant within the watershed and this issue is not expected to significantly alter results.
  - The HRU definition process should be reviewed for these unique cases.
  
2. Within the "pure" HBV-EC model configuration, :LakeStorage is used to move all precipitation that falls onto LAKE HRUs into a storage compartment.
The "pure" HBV-EC model configuration uses SOIL[2] as this storage compartment. Based on a recommendation from James Craig, this component of the model was removed since it's physical representation is dubious. Precipitation on LAKE HRUs is not added directly to the Surface Water store.

In addition, the "pure" HBV-EC model configuration also has a :LakeEvaporation term to evaporate water from the above storage components (i.e., SOIL[2]). Due to the poor physical representation of this process, coupled with the removal of the :LakeStorage term, :LakeEvaporation was removed from the HBV-EC configuration used in OHME V1.

These adjustments result in large mass balance errors reported for watersheds that have one or more reservoirs present. It was traced to originate in the cumulative loss term within the reservoir mass balance. James Craig advised that this is likely not an issue with the model itself, but the mass balance calculations/checks performed by Raven. However, additional QAQC by James is required.

3. Under residual streamflows (i.e., the inclusion of water demand from the OWDM and other diversions from the custom-timeseries), the Channel Storage compartment is observed to fill up. James Craig confirmed that this is an error in the mass balance calculations within Raven and will be fixed in due course.

4. Update plotting functions to respect disabled subbasins is they are reservoirs. Right now, an error is thrown if there is a disabled subbasin that is a reservoir, because no column exists. Therefore, Powers Creek reservoir plots always fail since Tadpole Lake is permanently disabled. Include a simple if/else to only plot what is there.
